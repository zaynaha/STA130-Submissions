    "#### (B) Similarity Between if/else and try/except\n",
    "A try/except block is used to handle exceptions (errors) that may arise in a code block, similar to how if/else handles different conditions. The idea is that if the code in the try block runs into an error, the program will catch the error and handle it in the except block.\n",
    "#### **Try/Except Structure:**\n",
    "`try:\n",
    "    # code that might raise an exception\n",
    " except SomeException:\n",
    "    # code to handle the exception`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example with try/except (Used in Monty Hall):** \n",
    "In the Monty Hall code you shared earlier, there's a try/except block to handle a situation where the contestant's door choice is already the winning door. If the door is already removed, it raises an error when trying to remove it again, which is caught and ignored in the except block:\n",
    "`try:\n",
    "    all_door_options_list.remove(my_door_choice) # attempt to remove my_door_choice from the list\n",
    "except:\n",
    "    pass # pass means do nothing (if my_door_choice was already removed)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case: Try: Python tries to remove my_door_choice from all_door_options_list. Except: If removing it raises an error (like ValueError because the door was already removed), it simply \"passes\" (does nothing) instead of crashing. This is similar to an if/else in the sense that it checks a situation and decides what to do based on the outcome, except here it’s based on whether an error occurs instead of a logical condition."

ChatBots can provide a good amount of explanation and inline clarifying code comments and provide more simpler more intuitive code that can transform something that looks a bit scary at first to something that's easy to follow and make sense of. Of course, in doing so, a ChatBot may introduce functions that you've technically not learned or seen before; but, the amount of simplification and clarifying comments is probably going to more than compensate for this; and, you'll have seen a learned a little bit more about what's possible through this process, which is the ideal experience we're hoping you'll see here._ \n",

Instead of using try/except to remove doors and catch errors, chat used list comprehensions to filter out the doors) This is easier to to follow for me. ChatGPT list comprehensions help in creating the remaining_doors list, which kept the code clean and efficient. A redundent step was removed - Duplicate Door Removal. The door was removed once per step. In terms of readability and explainability, I prefer the streamlined version as it uses clear list operations that make the process more intuitive, reducing room for error or confusion."

    "\n",
    "1. **Two Dictionaries**: \n",
    "   - `word_used`: Tracks how many times each word appears in the list of words.\n",
    "   - `next_word`: Tracks which words tend to follow each other and how often.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Loop**: \n",
    "   - The loop goes through each word (except the last one) in the list.\n",
    "   - For each word, the code:\n",
    "     - Checks if the word has already been encountered.\n",
    "     - If it has, the code adds 1 to its count in `word_used`. \n",
    "     - If it has not, the code starts counting it from 1 and creates an empty dictionary to track what comes after that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tracking Next Words**: \n",
    "   - The code also checks the word that comes right after the current word (called the \"next word\").\n",
    "   - If the next word has already been seen after the current word, it increases the count of how often this pairing happens.\n",
    "   - If it’s a new pairing, the code starts counting it from 1.\n"

Regarding the comments below (which will likely be relevant and useful for you), you might find the potential learning experience that this provides to be a quite the rabbit total rabbit hole and time sink. You might end up finding out that you spent way more time than I should on learning the code!! So be mindful of your time management as there is much to do for many classes!\n",
    ">    \n",
    "> _As you may or may not have already experienced in the previous problem, a ChatBot applied to this problem is likely to start explaining a bit more knowledge about Python than you need to know (as a student just trying to learn stats+DS); however, you'll probably feel like this \"out of scope\" context information is helpful to know (or at least be aware of) and easy to understand and learn if you use some addtional prompts to dig deeper into them. A ChatBot will be quite good at explaining and helping understand smaller chunks of code; however, if given too much information at once it can gloss over some information._\n",
    ">   \n",
    "> _That said, some topics here are potentially quite and advanced and too tricky! You might be able to ask the ChatBot to simplify its explanations and that might help a bit. But on the other hand, some topics, such as, \"how does `nested_dict = lambda: defaultdict(nested_dict)` work?\" might just simply be too advanced to really admit a simpler explanation via a ChatBot. You'll have to let these sorts of things go, if you come across explanations that just aren't improving or helping at at. In the case of `defaultdict(nested_dict)` specifically, the details here are well beyond the scope of STA130 and can be very safely ignored for now.

    "## Original Markovian Chatbot Code\n",
    "- The original code builds a Markov model to track word usage and transitions.\n",
    "- **Components**:\n",
    "  - `word_used`: Counts occurrences of each word.\n",
    "  - `next_word`: Stores counts of words that follow each word.\n",
    "- **Loop Logic**:\n",
    "  - Iterates through words, updates counts for `word_used` and `next_word`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested Improvements\n",
    "- Use `defaultdict` for simpler logic and automatic key initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markovian Chatbot Extension #2\n",
    "- **Character Processing**:\n",
    "  - Converts character names in the `avatar` dataset to uppercase and replaces spaces with dots.\n",
    "  - Uses `Counter` to count occurrences of character names.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Nested Dictionary Structure**:\n",
    "  - Utilizes a nested `defaultdict` to create `word_used2C` and `next_word2C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Building the Model**:\n",
    "  - Loops through words to create bigram chains (two-word sequences) specific to each character.\n",
    "  - Updates counts for bigrams and their subsequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Chains Created\n",
    "- **Bigram Chains**:\n",
    "  - Tracks pairs of consecutive words (bigrams) for each character.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Next Word Prediction**:\n",
    "  - For each bigram, tracks possible next words that follow, allowing for contextual responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- The chains enable dynamic character-specific interactions by leveraging the frequency and relationships between words.\n",
    "- The code allows the chatbot to generate contextually relevant responses based on character context.\n",

    "1. **Speed and Helpfulness of the ChatBot**:  \n",
    "   The ChatBot was quick to assist with the Monty Hall problem, demonstrating a solid understanding of the concept and providing a sample to clarify the explanation. However, when it came to the Markovian chatbot code, the initial response was less effective. The ChatBot misinterpreted the task as word-specific instead of character-specific despite my prompts. It required clear guidance before it adjusted its understanding, but once that was established, it quickly grasped the character-based Markov chains and effectively broke down the code into understandable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Frustration and Helpfulness in Interactions**:  \n",
    "   Interacting with the ChatBot was somewhat frustrating during the initial exchange about the Markovian chatbot code. Despite my clear descriptions, the ChatBot initially insisted on a misunderstanding regarding the specificity of the chains, which created a bit of confusion. However, after I clarified the details, it adapted its response and ultimately provided useful code that aligned with my requirements. Overall, while there were moments of frustration, the ChatBot eventually became helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overall Assessment of ChatBots for Coding Help**:  \n",
    "   My experiences with ChatBots have been largely positive. They possess a breadth of knowledge that often exceeds my own, providing valuable insights into coding errors and concepts. While some solutions might initially seem out of my scope, the ChatBot excels at explaining complex ideas in layman’s terms, making it a useful tool for understanding code better. In general, I find ChatBots to be effective assistants in my coding journey."
