    "# Research Proposal: Neighbors and Mental - Wellbeing\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Research Question\n",
    "Is there a relationship between the number of neighbors someone knows by name and their mental well-being?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** This question explores the potential association between social familiarity (knowing neighbors) and mental health. Knowing neighbors could indicate social connection, which may serve as a buffer against stress or loneliness. Understanding this connection could help guide community programs that foster neighborhood ties, thereby promoting mental well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Population Parameter of Interest\n",
    "**Parameter of Interest:** The population parameter of interest is the mean mental well-being score among individuals with varying levels of neighbor familiarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcome of Interest:** We aim to explore the association between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being, identifying any linear relationship between the two and examining its direction and strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Variables and Exploration Plan\n",
    "**Independent Variable:**  \n",
    "- **`CONNECTION_neighbours_name_num`**: Number of neighbors known by name (quantitative variable).  \n",
    "  **Label:** \"How many of your neighbors do you know by name?\"  \n",
    "  **Description:** This variable records the number of neighbors an individual knows by name, including those who live next door, in the same building, or on the same street.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependent Variable:**  \n",
    "- **`WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health`**: Mental well-being score (quantitative variable).  \n",
    "  **Label:** \"At the present time, would you say your MENTAL HEALTH is:\"  \n",
    "  **Description:** This variable captures an individual's self-rated mental health status.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification for Choosing These Variables:** These variables allow us to explore whether there’s a measurable association between community connections and mental well-being, an important topic with practical implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Planned Visualizations\n",
    "#### For Mental Well-Being Scores\n",
    "- **Histogram:** A histogram will visualize the distribution of mental well-being scores, allowing us to assess normality and understand the overall mental health landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Box Plot:** A box plot will provide summary statistics (median, quartiles) of mental well-being scores, highlighting the central tendency and variability within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Number of Neighbors Known\n",
    "- **Histogram:** A histogram will display the distribution of the number of neighbors known by name, providing insight into how many neighbors participants typically know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Relationship Between Variables\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot:** A scatter plot will visualize the relationship between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being scores, revealing any linear or non-linear trends that may exist between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Box Plot (Grouped by Neighbor Counts):** We will group participants by ranges of neighbors known (e.g., 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9+) and create box plots to compare their mental well-being scores. This will highlight any trends in mental well-being based on neighborhood familiarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Planned Analysis\n",
    "### Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "- **Hypotheses:**\n",
    "  - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** $( \\beta_1 \\leq 0 $) (there is no positive association between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being).\n",
    "  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** $( \\beta_1 > 0 $) (there is a positive association).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "1. **Simulating the Null Hypothesis:** We’ll generate a sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, which assumes no positive relationship between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Calculate Test Statistic:** For each simulated dataset, we’ll calculate the slope ($( \\beta_1 $)) of the regression line between the permuted mental well-being scores and the number of neighbors known.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Observing the Actual Slope:** We’ll calculate the slope ($( \\beta_1 $)) for the actual data (non-permuted). This value will represent the strength and direction of the observed relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate p-value:** The proportion of permuted slopes greater than or equal to the observed slope (for a one-sided test) will be our p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Rule:** If the p-value is below our chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we’ll reject the null hypothesis, suggesting a statistically significant positive association.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "- **Method:** A simple linear regression will quantify the effect of the number of neighbors known on mental well-being scores.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Interpretation:** The slope ($( \\beta_1 $)) will tell us if there’s an increase in mental well-being with each additional neighbor known by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected analysis methods for exploring the relationship between neighbor familiarity and mental well-being include data summarization, visualization, hypothesis testing, and simple linear regression. These methods are appropriate as they allow for a comprehensive examination of the association between the independent variable (number of neighbors known) and the dependent variable (mental well-being score). The assumptions for linear regression include linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals. Addressing these assumptions ensures the validity of the analysis results. The visualizations (scatter plot, box plot, and histogram) will help in assessing the distribution of the data and the relationship between the variables, while the hypothesis testing will provide insights into the statistical significance of the observed relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity:** The relationship between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being should be linear, which will be checked using scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independence:** The observations should be independent of one another. This means that the mental well-being of one individual should not influence that of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of mental well-being scores should remain constant across all levels of neighbor familiarity. This will be assessed through residual plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Normality of Residuals:** The residuals from the linear regression model should be approximately normally distributed, which will be checked using a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Hypothesis and Expected Results\n",
    "### Hypothesis:\n",
    "The hypothesis for this analysis is that knowing a greater number of neighbors by name will be positively associated with better mental well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Results:** We expect to observe a positive slope in the simple linear regression, indicating that increased neighbor familiarity correlates with higher mental well-being scores. If the p-value confirms this, it suggests that social connectedness within one’s neighborhood may contribute positively to mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Ethical Considerations\n",
    "- **Privacy and Confidentiality:** Anonymity is essential due to the sensitive nature of mental health data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Informed Consent and Transparency:** Participants should be fully informed about the use of their data for research purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Avoiding Harm and Misinterpretation:** Findings must be reported with caution to prevent misinterpretation and ensure results are used constructively.\n"

    "\n",
    "### 1. Research Question\n",
    "Does a larger gap between the amount of time people wish to spend with family and friends versus the actual time spent correlate with higher levels of everyday discrimination experiences?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**: This question investigates the impact of social isolation and unmet social needs on perceived discrimination. It’s interesting because it could highlight the psychosocial effects of discrimination, leading to a better understanding of how to support marginalized communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Population Parameter of Interest\n",
    "- **Parameter of Interest**: The population parameter of interest is the correlation between the gap in desired and actual social time with family members and the level of everyday discrimination experienced.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Outcome of Interest**: We want to explore whether a larger gap between desired and actual time spent with family correlates with increased levels of perceived everyday discrimination. This could help identify if unmet social needs are linked to feelings of being discriminated against.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Variables and Exploration Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "**Independent Variable**:\n",

    "- **Label**: \"In your day-to-day life, how often do you feel you are treated with less respect than other people?\"\n",
    "- **Description**: This variable assesses how often individuals feel they are treated with less respect in their everyday lives, serving as an indicator of perceived discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification for Choosing These Variables**: These variables are chosen to explore the relationship between unmet social needs and feelings of discrimination. The gap between desired and actual time spent with family may reveal psychological impacts, such as increased feelings of disrespect or marginalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Planned Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Box Plot (Actual Time Spent with Family)**: A box plot will visualize the distribution of actual time spent socializing with family members. This will help identify the median, quartiles, and any outliers in the data, providing insights into how much time individuals typically spend with their family.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Box Plot (Preferred Time with Family)**: A box plot will display the distribution of preferred time spent with family members. This visualization will similarly illustrate the median, quartiles, and outliers, allowing for a comparison of how much time individuals wish to spend with family versus how much time they actually spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Histogram (Gap in Time)**: A histogram will show the distribution of the gap between preferred and actual time spent with family. This will provide a clear visual representation of how significant the unmet social needs are among individuals and identify any outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bar Chart (Categorical Discrimination Levels)**: A bar chart will visualize the frequency of reported discrimination experiences across different categories. This will help understand how many individuals report feeling respected versus those who feel disrespected in their day-to-day lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once individual visualizations have provided insights, we can examine the relationship between the gap in social time and discrimination experiences:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Discrimination Scoring\n",
    "To facilitate correlation analysis, we will assign numerical scores to the categorical discrimination levels reported by participants. For example:\n",
    "- \"Always respected\" = 0\n",
    "- \"Often respected\" = 1\n",
    "- \"Sometimes respected\" = 2\n",
    "- \"Rarely respected\" = 3\n",
    "- \"Never respected\" = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "This scoring system will enable us to perform correlation and regression analyses on the relationship between the gap in social time and perceived discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scatter Plot with Linear Regression Line (Gap and Discrimination Levels)**: A scatter plot will depict the relationship between the gap in time spent with family and the numerical discrimination scores. Including a linear regression line will help illustrate any trends or correlations, allowing for a clearer understanding of how the gap in social time correlates with perceived discrimination levels.\n",

    "2. **Calculate Test Statistic**: Calculate the correlation for each simulated dataset.\n",
    "3. **Observe the Actual Correlation**: Calculate the correlation for the actual data using the numerical scores assigned to discrimination experiences.\n",
    "4. **Calculate p-value**: Determine the proportion of simulated correlations that are greater than or equal to the observed correlation.\n",
    "5. **Decision Rule**: If the p-value < 0.05, reject H₀.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Simple Linear Regression\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: A simple linear regression will quantify the relationship between the gap in time spent with family and the numerical discrimination scores. The slope (β₁) will indicate how an increase in the gap correlates with an increase in perceived discrimination experiences, suggesting that unmet social needs may predict higher discrimination levels.\n",
