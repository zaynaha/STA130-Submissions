    "### Research Proposal: Neighbors and Mental Well-Being\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research Question**  \n",
    "   - **Question**: Is there a relationship between the number of neighbors someone knows by name and their mental well-being?\n",
    "   - **Rationale**: This question explores the potential association between social familiarity (knowing neighbors) and mental health. Knowing neighbors could indicate social connection, which may serve as a buffer against stress or loneliness. Understanding this connection could help guide community programs that foster neighborhood ties, thereby promoting mental well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Population Parameter of Interest**  \n",
    "   - **Parameter of Interest**: The population parameter of interest is the association between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being. Specifically, we aim to identify whether mental well-being varies systematically with levels of neighbor familiarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Outcome of Interest**  \n",
    "   - **Objective**: To explore the association between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being, identifying any linear relationship between the two and examining its direction and strength.\n",

    "\n",
    "   4.2 **Dependent Variable**  \n",
    "      - **Variable Name**: `WELLNESS_self_rated_mental_health`\n",
    "      - **Label**: \"At the present time, would you say your MENTAL HEALTH is:\"\n",
    "      - **Description**: Categorical variable capturing an individual's self-rated mental health status, with categories:\n",
    "         - 'Excellent'\n",
    "         - 'Very good'\n",
    "         - 'Good'\n",

    "         - 'Poor'\n",
    "         - 'Presented but no response'\n",
    "      - **Type**: Categorical (ordinal)\n",
    "\n",
    "   4.3 **Justification for Choosing These Variables**  \n",
    "      - These variables allow us to explore whether there’s a measurable association between community connections and mental well-being, an important topic with practical implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Planned Visualizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "   5.1 **For Mental Well-Being Scores**  \n",
    "      - **Bar Chart**: A bar chart will visualize the frequency distribution of mental well-being scores, allowing us to assess the most common mental health statuses among participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5.2 **For Number of Neighbors Known**  \n",
    "      - **Bar Chart**: A bar chart will display the distribution of the number of neighbors known by name, providing insight into how many neighbors participants typically know.\n",
    "\n",
    "   5.3 **Overall Relationship Between Variables**  \n",
    "      - **Mosaic Plot**: A mosaic plot will visualize the joint distribution of neighbor familiarity and mental well-being, revealing patterns or associations between the two categorical variables.\n",
    "      - **Grouped Bar Chart**: A grouped bar chart will compare the mental well-being scores across different categories of neighbor familiarity, highlighting any trends based on neighborhood connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Planned Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "   6.1 **Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Hypotheses**:  \n",
    "         - Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no relationship between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being (i.e., the mental well-being scores are equal across all categories of neighbor familiarity).\n",
    "         - Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant relationship between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being (i.e., the mental well-being scores differ across categories of neighbor familiarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Chi-Square Test**: Given that both variables are categorical, we will conduct a chi-square test of independence to assess if there’s a statistically significant association between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: In addition to the chi-square test, we will conduct multinomial logistic regression to model the relationship between the number of neighbors known and mental well-being scores. This method is particularly suited for our analysis since both the independent and dependent variables are categorical.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      - **Steps for Multinomial Logistic Regression**:  \n",
    "         - **Model Specification**: Specify the multinomial logistic regression model where the dependent variable (mental well-being) has multiple categories and the independent variable (number of neighbors known) is also categorical.\n",
    "         - **Parameter Estimation**: The regression will estimate the probabilities of each category of mental well-being based on the number of neighbors known.\n",
    "         - **Interpretation of Results**: The estimated coefficients will indicate how changes in neighbor familiarity influence the odds of being in each category of mental well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Assumptions for Analysis**  \n",
    "   - **Independence**: The observations should be independent of one another, meaning that the mental well-being of one individual should not influence that of another.\n",
    "   - **Sufficient Sample Size**: Each category of the dependent variable should have an adequate number of observations to ensure reliable estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Handling Missing Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Identifying Missing Values**: Check for any missing values in the dataset. `missing_values = df.isnull().sum()`\n",
    "   - **Removing Missing Data**: Drop rows with missing values to ensure a complete dataset for analysis. `df_cleaned = df.dropna()`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Hypothesis and Expected Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Hypothesis**: Knowing a greater number of neighbors by name will be positively associated with better mental well-being.\n",
    "   - **Expected Results**: We expect to find that individuals who know more neighbors will report higher mental well-being scores. The multinomial logistic regression should reveal significant associations, indicating that social connectedness within one’s neighborhood may contribute positively to mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Ethical Considerations**  \n",
    "    - **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Anonymity is essential due to the sensitive nature of mental health data.\n",
    "    - **Informed Consent and Transparency**: Participants should be fully informed about the use of their data for research purposes.\n",
    "    - **Avoiding Harm and Misinterpretation**: Findings must be reported with caution to prevent misinterpretation and ensure results are used constructively."

    "### Research Proposal: Everyday Discrimination and Social Isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Research Question***\n",
    "Does a larger gap between the amount of time people wish to spend with family and friends versus the actual time spent correlate with higher levels of everyday discrimination experiences?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Population Parameter of Interest***\n",
    "- **Parameter of Interest:** The population parameter of interest is the correlation between the gap in desired and actual social time with family members and the level of everyday discrimination experienced.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Variables and Exploration Plan***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Independent Variable:**\n",
    "- **Variable Name:** `CONNECTION_social_time_family_p7d_grouped` (Actual time spent with family)\n",
    "- **Type:** Ordinal Categorical\n",
    "- **Unique Values:** ['5 or more hours', '1 to 4 hours', 'Less than 1 hour', 'No time', 'Presented but no response']\n",
    "\n",
    "**Desired Time Variable:**\n",
    "- **Variable Name:** `CONNECTION_preference_time_family_grouped` (Preferred time with family)\n",
    "- **Type:** Ordinal Categorical\n",
    "- **Unique Values:** ['5 or more hours', '1 to 4 hours', 'No time', 'Less than 1 hour', 'Presented but no response']\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gap Variable:**\n",
    "- **Gap Calculation:** The gap is quantitatively assessed by assigning numerical values to the categories of preferred and actual time spent with family. The assigned values are as follows:\n",
    "  - '5 or more hours' = 4\n",
    "  - '1 to 4 hours' = 3\n",
    "  - 'Less than 1 hour' = 2\n",
    "  - 'No time' = 1\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The gap size is calculated by subtracting the actual time value from the preferred time value:\n",
    "  $[\n",
    "  \\text{Gap} = \\text{Preferred Time Value} - \\text{Actual Time Value}\n",
    "  $]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Justification for Assigning Numerical Values to Gap Categories:**\n",
    "  Assigning numerical values to the preferred and actual time categories is a way to quantify the \"gap\" between desired and actual time spent with family, making it easier to analyze this variable. The values are selected based on the ordinal nature of the categories, with higher values representing more time. Here’s why each category was assigned these specific values:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Categorical Meaning and Order:**\n",
    "    - The values assigned (1 through 4) directly correspond to the amount of time described in each category, with 'No time' (least amount) assigned 1 and '5 or more hours' (most amount) assigned 4.\n",
    "    - This scale reflects the ordinal structure: as the numerical value increases, the category represents a greater quantity of time, maintaining the order and meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Uniform Gaps Between Values:**\n",
    "    - Using a simple 1-point difference between each category makes the gap calculation straightforward. The chosen values maintain a balanced progression, allowing us to calculate the difference in social time in a way that is easy to interpret and categorize as 'Large Gap,' 'Small Gap,' or 'No Gap.'\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Interpretability:**\n",
    "    - By assigning these values, we quantify the \"gap\" in a way that allows us to categorize it (e.g., 2-point or greater differences indicate a \"Large Gap\"), supporting an intuitive understanding of whether there is a significant difference between preferred and actual social time. This simplification helps in interpreting results in later analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Example Calculation:**\n",
    "    - If someone prefers to spend '5 or more hours' with family but only spends 'No time,' the difference is calculated as \\(4 - 1 = 3\\), which falls into the 'Large Gap' category, illustrating a noticeable gap between desired and actual time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The gap categories will be defined as:\n",
    "  - **Large Gap:** If the gap is greater than 2 (e.g., preferring 5 or more hours but spending 'No time' or 'Less than 1 hour').\n",
    "  - **Small Gap:** If the gap is between 0 and 2 (e.g., preferring '1 to 4 hours' but spending 'Less than 1 hour').\n",
    "  - **No Gap:** If the gap equals 0 (e.g., preferred time matches actual time).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependent Variable:**\n",
    "- **Variable Name:** `LIFECOURSE_everyday_discrimination_respect` (Everyday discrimination experiences)\n",
    "- **Type:** Categorical\n",
    "- **Unique Values:** [NaN, 'Never', 'At least once a week', 'Less than once a year', 'A few times a month', 'A few times a year', 'Almost every day']\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Data**\n",
    "In the analysis, any rows containing missing data (NaN) will be removed from the dataset. This decision is based on the following justifications:\n",
    "- 1. **Completeness of Analysis:** Missing data can lead to biased estimates and undermine the integrity of statistical analyses. By removing rows with missing values, we ensure that the analysis is conducted on complete cases, which provides a clearer understanding of the relationships between variables.\n",
    "- 2. **Sample Size:** The remaining data will still provide a robust sample size, which is critical for the validity of statistical tests.\n",
    "- 3. **Simplicity and Clarity:** Removing missing data simplifies the dataset and makes it easier to interpret results without dealing with the complexities that missing values introduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Planned Visualizations**\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively communicate the findings, the following visualizations will be employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. **Box Plot of Actual Time Spent with Family:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** To visually represent the distribution of actual time spent with family across the different categories (e.g., '5 or more hours', '1 to 4 hours', etc.). This helps identify the central tendency and spread of the data.\n",
    "   - **Implementation:** Use `seaborn` or `matplotlib` to create a box plot, where the x-axis represents the time categories and the y-axis represents the frequency or number of respondents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. **Box Plot of Preferred Time with Family:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** To compare how much time individuals prefer to spend with family, providing insights into overall social desires.\n",
    "   - **Implementation:** Similar to the actual time box plot, but focusing on the preferred time categories. This will help highlight differences between what individuals wish for versus what they actually experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. **Bar Chart of Gap Categories:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** To show the frequency of different gap sizes (No Gap, Small Gap, Large Gap). This visualization will clarify how many individuals fall into each category.\n",
    "   - **Implementation:** Create a bar chart with the gap categories on the x-axis and the number of respondents in each category on the y-axis, allowing for easy comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. **Bar Chart of Categorical Discrimination Levels:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** To visualize the distribution of everyday discrimination experiences among participants, highlighting the prevalence of different levels of reported discrimination.\n",
    "   - **Implementation:** The x-axis will represent the levels of discrimination (e.g., 'Never', 'A few times a year', etc.), while the y-axis will show the number of respondents reporting each level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5. **Heatmap of Gap Size vs. Everyday Discrimination Levels:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** To investigate the relationship between the size of the gap in family time preferences and levels of everyday discrimination. The heatmap allows for a clear visual representation of how these two variables interact.\n",
    "   - **Implementation:** \n",
    "     - The x-axis represents levels of everyday discrimination, categorized into groups such as 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High'.\n",
    "     - The y-axis represents the gap size, calculated based on the difference between preferred and actual family time.\n",
    "     - Each cell in the heatmap displays a color intensity corresponding to the average gap size for that specific combination of discrimination level and gap size category.\n",
    "     - **Interpretation:** By utilizing the heatmap, we can identify patterns or trends in the data. Areas with a darker color may indicate larger gaps in family time preferences among respondents experiencing higher levels of discrimination. This visualization provides insights into how discrimination may impact family dynamics, facilitating a deeper understanding of the social factors at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Planned Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Investigative Methods:**\n",
    "1. **Sampling Method:**\n",
    "   - We will utilize **random sampling** to select participants from a larger population to ensure representativeness.\n",
    "   - The sample size should be sufficient to provide enough power for statistical tests (ideally a minimum of 30 participants for each group).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assumptions of the Model:**\n",
    "   - The data collected must be representative of the population.\n",
    "   - The observations must be independent of one another.\n",
    "   - The dependent variable (everyday discrimination) is categorical, while the independent variable (the gap in social time) is treated as ordinal.\n",
    "   - The ordinal logistic regression assumes proportional odds, which means the relationship between each pair of outcome groups is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Statistical Tests:**\n",
    "   - **Ordinal Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "     - We will model the relationship between the gap in social time (independent variable) and everyday discrimination levels (dependent variable).\n",
    "     - The model will be fitted using the `statsmodels` library in Python, with the formula specified as:\n",
    "       $[\n",
    "       \\text{Discrimination Level} \\sim \\text{Gap Category}\n",
    "       $]\n",
    "     - We will assess the model's fit using the likelihood ratio test.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Chi-Square Test of Independence:**\n",
    "     - This test will analyze the association between gap categories and levels of discrimination.\n",
    "     - The null hypothesis states that there is no association between the two categorical variables.\n",
    "     - We will create a contingency table to summarize the frequencies of the gap categories across discrimination levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculating the p-value:**\n",
    "   - For the Chi-Square test, we will use the formula:\n",
    "     $[\n",
    "     \\text{p-value} = P(\\chi^2 \\geq \\text{observed } \\chi^2 \\text{ statistic} \\mid H_0)\n",
    "     $]\n",
    "   - The test will be conducted using `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency` in Python, which will return the chi-square statistic and p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reporting Results:**\n",
    "   - The results will be presented in a report format, including:\n",

    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no relationship between everyday discrimination and the number of neighbors known by name (i.e., the association is not significant).\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** There is a significant relationship between experiences of discrimination and the number of neighbors known by name (i.e., the association is significant).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Hypothesis and Expected Results**\n",
    "- **Hypothesis Statement:** If individuals experience higher levels of everyday discrimination, they are likely to know fewer neighbors by name, suggesting that social ties may be negatively impacted by discriminatory experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relevance of Results:** The results will clarify whether experiences of discrimination influence community engagement. A significant association would suggest that addressing discrimination could improve social cohesion and support within communities, ultimately enhancing community ties.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Ethical Considerations**\n",
    "When conducting this research, the following ethical considerations will be prioritized:\n",
    "- **Informed Consent:** Participants will be fully informed about the study's purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits before giving their consent to participate.\n",
    "- **Confidentiality:** All data collected will be kept confidential and anonymized to protect participants' identities and personal information.\n",
    "- **Sensitive Topics:** Participants may feel discomfort discussing their experiences of discrimination. Researchers will provide resources for support and allow participants to withdraw from the study at any time without consequences.\n",
    "- **Fair Treatment:** Participants from diverse backgrounds should be treated fairly and equitably throughout the research process, ensuring that their voices are heard and respected.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these ethical considerations, the research will prioritize participant well-being and integrity, fostering a respectful and supportive environment.\n"
