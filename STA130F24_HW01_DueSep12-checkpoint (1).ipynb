    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",

    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question \"7\" above, `df.describe()` would have different values in the `count` value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data.

Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Understanding df.describe():\n",
    "I learned that df.describe() provides summary statistics for numeric columns, such as count, mean, standard deviation, and quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%). It ignores missing data, which affects the statistics like count but still returns results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed why these statistics are only applicable to numeric data, which clarified an earlier question from the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Missing Data:\n",
    "I explored two main methods for handling missing data:\n",
    "df.dropna(): Removes rows with missing values.\n",
    "del df['col']: Deletes entire columns with too many missing values.\n",
    "I learned that using del df['col'] before df.dropna() can make the data-cleaning process more efficient.\n",

    "### Analyzing the Titanic Dataset:\n",
    "I downloaded and explored the Titanic dataset using Pandas.\n",
    "I ran the df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() command to group data by a column and calculate statistics for another column.\n",
    "Errors and troubleshooting techniques were discussed, such as importing Pandas, fixing file name typos, and correcting column names.\n",
